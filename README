MPTCP-BPF
=========

All bpf programs and scripts are in mptcp-bpf/:

    cd mptcp-bpf/


To run the test negotiating MPTCP scheduler:

    make && sudo ./test_mptcp_sched_user bpf_mptcp_option_scheduler.o ./my_net_red_scheduler.sh -q

To run the test capping bandwidth on a subflow:

    make && sudo ./test_mptcp_user bpf_mptcp_cap_bw_kern.o ./my_net_cap_bw.sh -q

To run the test with delay-based priority option:

    make && sudo ./test_mptcp_user bpf_mptcp_priority_kern.o ./my_net_delay_threshold.sh


Recreate subflow test:

    make && sudo ./test_mptcp_user   bpf_mptcp_pm_recreate.o  ./my_net_pm_recreate.sh -q


Fullmesh netns test:

   make && sudo ./my_net_pm.sh

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
